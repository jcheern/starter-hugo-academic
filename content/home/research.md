## Dissertation
 
*  "Partisanship and Policy Decisions at State Public Utility Commissions and Impacts on Climate Change Mitigation"    
    *  Committee: Sarah Binder (Chair), Eric Lawrence, Chris Warshaw

Public utility commissions (PUCs) play a potentially significant role in addressing climate change through their high level of control over state energy policy. However, political scientists have not yet systematically addressed this potential relationship. This project examines influences of PUC policy decisions--particularly the partisan composition of commissions--and how those policy decisions may impact climate change. I collect novel data on all 817 public utility commissioners from 50 states from 2000-2020, including their terms of service, partisanship, and professional backgrounds. I then test the determinants of partisan selection and professional backgrounds of public utility commissioners. I then add novel data on commission decisions related to the electrical power industry and whether final orders were decided in a pro- or anti-environmental direction. It is tested whether the partisan composition of PUCs has an impact on environmental policy choices. These policy decisions are related to conditions indicative of climate change mitigation like renewable energy deployment and carbon dioxide emissions from the energy industry. The project concludes with a case study comparison of the Texas and California PUCs. This in-depth qualitative comparison adds more context to the ways in which Democratic and Republican PUCs operate, and how their policy decisions may or may not significantly shape environmental conditions.
