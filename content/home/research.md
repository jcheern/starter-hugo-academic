## Dissertation
 
*  "Partisanship and Policy Decisions at State Public Utility Commissions and Impacts on Climate Change Mitigation"    
    *  Committee: Sarah Binder (Chair), Eric Lawrence, Chris Warshaw

Public utility commissions (PUCs) play a potentially significant role in addressing climate change through their high level of control over state energy policy. However these institutions have been understudied, especially in the context of climate change. This project examines the influences on PUC policy decisions--particularly the partisan composition of commissions--and how those policy decisions then impact climate change. To accomplish this I collect novel data on all 817 public utility commissioners from 50 states from 2000-2020. This data included their terms of service, partisanship, and professional backgrounds. I then test the determinants of partisan selection and professional backgrounds of public utility commissioners. The project then adds novel data on commission decisions related to the electrical power industry and whether final orders were decided in a pro- or anti-environmental direction. It is tested whether the partisan composition of PUCs has an impact on environmental policy choices. Finally, these policy decisions are related to conditions indicative of climate change mitigation like renewable energy deployment and carbon dioxide emissions from the energy industry.
