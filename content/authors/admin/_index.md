Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Environment and Society at Brown University, also affiliated with the Climate Social Science Network. I received a Ph.D. in Political Science as a Policy Studies Endowment Fellow at George Washington University in August 2022. Originally from rural Southern Illinois, I earned a B.A. in Political Science with minors in environmental studies and biology from Truman State University in Northeast Missouri. Growing up in an area developed through the coal industry, but surrounded by a national forest and state parks, I was driven to better understand the balancing act between the energy industry and environmental protection. This guided my research as an undergraduate and was further influenced by nine months working in all three branches of the Missouri government. I primarily worked with state utility regulation and energy policy in the Missouri Senate and Department of Natural Resources. 

My research is generally concerned with better understanding how and why the federal and state governments address (or do not address) climate change. I focus on energy and environmental politics and policy, primarily in the contexts of executive and legislative branch behavior, partisanship, interests groups, and public opinion and representation. 

My dissertation examined the influence of partisanship and other forces on the policy decisions of state public utility commissions (PUCs)--responsible for regulating a substantial portion of state electrical power policy--and how those policy decisions ultimately impact conditions related to climate change. I have assembled expansive original data on the characteristics of the public utility commissioners who served in all 50 states from 2000 to 2020 and coded a large volume of their policy decisions in a growing sample of 10 states. This project has stimulated an active research agenda on the politics and policy decisions of PUCs that can inform our understanding of climate change policymaking, state politics, gubernatorial appointments, legislative control of the bureaucracy, interest group strategies and influence, and other areas.
