I am a Policy Studies Endowment Fellow and PhD candidate in political science at George Washington University, expecting to defend my dissertation sometime during Spring 2022. Originally from rural Southern Illinois, I earned a BA in political science with minors in environmental studies and biology from Truman State University in Northeast Missouri. Growing up in an area developed through the coal industry, but surrounded by a national forest and state parks, I was driven to better understand the balancing act between the energy industry and environmental protection. This guided my research as an undergraduate and was further influenced by nine months working in all three branches of the Missouri government. I primarily worked with state utility regulation and energy generation policy in the Missouri Senate and Department of Natural Resources which led to my research agenda as a graduate student. 

Currently, my research focuses on energy and environmental politics and policy, particularly in the contexts of legislative and executive branch behavior, public opinion and representation, and partisanship. My research is broadly characterized by a desire to better understand how the federal and state governments engage with climate change mitigation. My dissertation examines the role that partisanship plays on the environmental policy decisions of state public utility commissions--responsible for regulating a substantial portion of the energy policy within a state--and how those policy decisions ultimately impact conditions related to climate change.
